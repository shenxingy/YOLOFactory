#  .gitignore for Python / PyTorch / YOLOv8 Projects
# ==============================================================================

# --- Standard Python Artifacts ---
# Ignore Python bytecode and cache directories
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Ignore distribution and build artifacts
build/
dist/
*.egg-info/
*.so

# --- Virtual Environments ---
# Ignore virtual environment folders (e.g., venv, .venv, env)
/venv/
/.venv/
/env/
/yolo/ # Ignoring the virtual environment shown in your prompt

# --- IDE and OS Specific Files ---
# Ignore settings from popular IDEs and OS-specific metadata files
.idea/
.vscode/
.DS_Store
*.swp

# --- Log and Credential Files ---
# Ignore log files and environment variable files
*.log
.env

#  Machine Learning / YOLOv8 Specific
# ==============================================================================

# --- Training & Prediction Runs ---
# This is the most important one. The 'runs' directory contains all generated
# models, logs, and plots from training/prediction. These are artifacts.
/runs/

# --- Datasets ---
# Datasets are typically too large for a Git repository.
# Only commit a README inside this folder explaining how to get the data.
/datasets/

# --- Pre-trained Model Weights ---
# Ignore downloaded base models like yolov8s.pt.
# Anyone running the code can download them automatically.
yolo*.pt
*.pt

# The above '*.pt' is a strong rule. If you create a specific 'weights'
# directory for your FINAL models and want to track them, you can
# comment out '*.pt' and use the line below instead:
# /weights/


# --- Explicitly keep some files if needed ---
# If you have a README in your datasets folder, you can force Git to keep it.
# !/datasets/README.md
